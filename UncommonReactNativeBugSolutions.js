The solutions vary depending on the specific bug. For library compatibility, ensure the library is compatible with the React Native version. For async/await issues, use `.then()` to handle the promise properly or await the result before accessing values.  If state updates are causing errors, ensure that state updates are done correctly by using `setState`.  For native module problems, double-check the native code and ensure it integrates correctly with the JavaScript side. Navigation errors often require a careful review of navigation configuration and implementation.
