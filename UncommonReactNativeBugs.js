This error occurs when you are using a library that is not compatible with React Native's version or when you try to import a module that is not installed.  It can also happen from incorrect use of async/await or Promises. For example, trying to access a value from an asynchronous operation before it's resolved will cause an error. Incorrect use of state updates can also lead to unexpected behavior.  Another uncommon error stems from improper handling of native modules or when there's a mismatch between the native and JavaScript parts of your app.  Incorrectly setting up or using navigation within your app is another source of subtle errors.
